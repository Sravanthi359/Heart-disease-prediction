Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
1. Introduction
The project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning models based on medical data.

The dataset includes patient details such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG results.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values and handled any inconsistencies.

Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical data to improve model performance.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

3. Handling Imbalanced Data
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was used to balance the dataset.

Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE) were applied to enhance model efficiency.

4. Model Selection & Training
Evaluated multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Neural Networks

Used performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.

5. Conclusion
Random Forest with SMOTE performed best, achieving around 96.8% accuracy.

Feature Engineering & PCA improved model performance.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early detection of heart disease, potentially helping doctors make better decisions.
